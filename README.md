# Weather Dashboard

## Description
The website uses One Call API's weather data to generate real-time weather data for select cities. It was designed with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS and implements JavaScript and jQuery. It includes features such as displaying icons to describe the weather, displaying the UV index and other weather relevant data, and providing a search history for cities recently searched. It was one of my first projects I created during a coding bootcamp at UCLA Extension and had a fun time working on it.
