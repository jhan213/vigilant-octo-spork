# Weather Dashboard

## Description
The website uses One Call API's weather data to generate real-time weather data for select cities. It was designed with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS and implements JavaScript and jQuery. It was one of my first projects I created during a coding bootcamp and was a fun project to work on.
